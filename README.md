This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To connect to the backend, please install the following Python dependencies.
```bash
pip install Flask
# and 
pip install -U flask-cors
```
Then, head to the root directory and run ``source venv/bin/activate``.

We need to set-up a pocketbase for the backend and database.

Please install the [pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/docs/) according to your system's architecture and replace the current file in ``uplift/backend/database``.

To manage the database, please run ``./pocketbase serve``

Finally, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

And you're all set! Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser and enjoy the application. 

Please note that our app is best suited with the viewport of 800px Ã— 1200px but in the future, we will implement full responsiveness.
